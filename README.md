# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
Converting Speech signals to Text format
Automatic speech recognition (ASR) converts a speech signal to text, mapping a sequence of audio inputs to text outputs. Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa use ASR models to help users everyday, and there are many other useful user-facing applications like live captioning and note-taking during meetings.
In this project finetune Wav2Vec2 on the MInDS-14 dataset to transcribe audio to text.
Use your finetuned model for inference.
# Wav2Vec2 Model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)<br>
The paper Wav2vec 2.0: A Framework for Self-Supervised Learning of Speech Representations described the facebook Wav2Vec2 model. The following figures shows the architecture of Wav@Vec@ model.
